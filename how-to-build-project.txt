There are three settings you will need to change before building and debugging works as expected.  Please note I have only tested this in VS 2012 Ultimate, but it shouldn't be a stretch to figure it out for other versions.

 - The output directory defines where the project's 'exports library file' (.exp), 'object file library' (.lib), and 'program debug database' (.pdb) files go.  Ideally you would have a test instance of NP++ somewhere, and this output directory would point to the plugins folder of the test np++ instance.
1) Project Properties -> (left pane) Configuration Properties -> General -> (content pane) Output Directory

 - The Linker Output File defines where the project's 'Application extension' (.dll) and 'Incremental Linker File' (.ilk) files go.  Place this in the same directory as you defined in step 1.
2) Project Properties -> (left pane) Configuration Properties -> Linker -> (content pane) Output File

 - The Debugging 'Command' is the executable that's run upon debugging.  If you want to debug this code, point this to your test instance of np++
3) Project Properties -> (left pane) Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> (content pane) Command

You should now be able to build and debug the project.
