The following is a somewhat comprehensive testing procedure to verify all functionality.  Please add to this document if you add new features.

 - Clear search flags save Filename included + Always remember user selection radio sort
 + Case sensitive search
 + Only look at start of filename or path (works in all three scenarios filename/filepath/filename or filepath)
 + Use only files in the current view

 - Clear Flags
 + Auto size columns
 + Auto size window
 + Use separate column for view
 + Use home and end keys for textbox
 + Enable Wildcard Asterisk

 - Clear Flags
 + Default Sort Order Always remember
 * Default Sort Order Filename, Path
 * Default Sort Order Path, Filename
 * Default Sort Order Index

 * Each of above sort orders with sort descending (also make sure it doesn't work if checked+disabled with always remember)
 * Each of above sort orders with reset to default selected

 - Back to Always remember
 + include only filename
 * include only path
 * include only file index
 * include only view
 + include all

 - Back to Always remember and only including Filename
 + Map ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab to plugin's mappings of next and previous tab respectively
 - Clear all ctrl-tab behavior flags
 ^ make sure ctrl tab works with both one and two views.
 + override sort order to tab order when ctrl-tabbing
 + show switcher window when ctrl+tabbing
 ^ make sure switcher window shows index and active documents whether search context is configured or not
 + revert sort order if typing begins during ctrl+tabbing (basically, type a letter while holding ctrl, the search window should now be permanent, searching the active documents.  Make sure this doesn't happen if disabled as well).

 - Back to ony including Filename
 + Configure search context (make sure file index and view aren't included when checked+disabled)
 ^ Test search context when using only files in the current view is checked+disabled
 ^ Test search context with "separate column for view" is checked+disabled
 ^ Test directory with larger than traversed file max
 ^ Test max displayed files
 ^ Test bad search directory
 + Case sensitive search
 + Only look at start of filename and/or path
 + Auto size columns
 + Auto size window
 
 - Clear Search flags (still keep configure search context)
 + Use Home/End keys for text box
 + Enable Wildcard Asterisk
 + Only look at start of filename and/or path
 + Add Path as well as Filename for search include
 * Remove Filename (only path is included)
